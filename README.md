# LoLRand
Creates an entirely randomized experience for League of Legends, including champions, items, and more.

The project isn't up to date with League, it doesn't have the newest champions, or account for the updated rune system. This is an old project that I'm mostly uploading
for posterity, and won't be updated.

LoLRand was created under Riot Games' "Legal Jibber Jabber" policy using assets owned by Riot Games.  Riot Games does not endorse or sponsor this project.
